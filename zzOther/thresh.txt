He chilled me, unlike the bitter winters of home ever could.
It was something in the calmness of his echoing voice, or the purpose of his stride, that gave a sense of hollow forboding I hadnt felt before.
I felt it since he first spoke to me, that cold void, and though i smiled and played my part, the coldness stayed with me.
He looks towards me, his eyes glow through slits in the mask that is his face, politness in every breathy word and what might be a cruel grin.

"Greetings Ashe", chains clink and the lantern rattles as he sweeps his arm low in a formal bow, "chief of the Avarosan and rightful queen of the Freljord."
Empty words from a tongue-less mouth. Practiced and formal. Deliberate.

He rises from his supplication with all the patience of a stone, metal clang of chains and keys, his mask turned back towards me, empty eyes deathly still.
No breath passed his lips, no breeze rustled his cloak, but the mask billowed restlessly in the not-wind.
Waiting for me.
I almost choked on my words.
"Greetings warden Thresh, it is an honour to have the assistance of the shadow isles."

A cold raspy laugh as the corners of the mask-mouth jerked up into a smirk.
"Not at all my dear", his echoing chuckle chilled the sentiment.  "I'm sure this will be a most invigorating day."

***

Winters at home are harsh at best.
On the moonless nights the fires may be dim, small, and warmth only a distant memory.
But the cold was home, its brisk embrace kept me whole, reminding me who i am.
This was different.

The chill runs through me, nagging and persistant.
Crouching behind a rock i feel the shade creep over me, my heart pumps ice through my frozen body, steady beating.
I clutch my bow, holding close the symbol of my people, of my strength, but the limbs rattle where my arms begin to shiver.
I must not let it consume me.
The chain warden is an ally.

A blast of wind rushes past me, breaking my reverie.
Fierce and alive, it lifts the stones and dust and hurls the maelstrom at my shelter.
Amidst the flurry of leaves and pebbles i remembered warmth.
The heat of battle.

I dive from my cover and dash towards the tall grass.
I run, catching a glimpse of the storm's fury overhead.
She glides through the air, a graceful dancer on her cloudy stage.
And the air dances with her, willing partner, trailing golden hair and gostly cloth through the breezy heights, like so many festival streamers.
Effortlessly she twirls her arms and flicks the staff, leading the wind in her aerial ballet.

As I duck into the grass, its stillness swallows me whole.
The nagging coldness returns.
Thresh sits here, propped against a small shrub, an arrow jutts sidewats from his calf, black ooze dripping from the wound.
The empty mask admires the arrow, no pain crosses his face nor tenses his body, but a careful studiousness, almost curisoty.
His hands move with calm and patience, grasping the arrow by its shaft and sliding it out.
Tendrils of black sludge cling to the tip, trailing gostly strands, threads of corruption, spun like spiders' silk through the air and sinking lazily to the ground.
"The dark one has good aim, but the one in the sky is bothersome."
