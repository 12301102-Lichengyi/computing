Instance
this is the game logic and event simulator.
- local, provides fine grained information to interface, i.e. GUI has an ACTUAL INSTANCE of this object to ask game information of
- Networked, Also provides fine grained information, coarse grained network info handled behind scenes

Interface
- Graphical user interface and control section

Liquids & Gases
- Temperature (x cold, v cold, cold, warm, hot, v hot, x hot, N/A)
- -300 - -50, -50 - 0, 0 - 10, 10 - 40, 40 - 120, 120 - 250, 250-5000 
- gaseous physics (osmosis), liquids mix/react instantly

Machine lines
- Machinery blocks connected together
- Refrigeration/heating, electricity, actuation(power), computation?
- Machines may have range limitations (heat vent within 10 units of heating cell

Blocks
- Reserve 2 bits for orientation

Thermal unit
- Powered machine produces "coldness" or hotness"
- Upgrades produce different ammounts of coldness/hotness
- Connect machines to perform temperature functions
- - Complex heating unit produces 30 hotness, cooking oven requires 10 hotness
- - 3 Simple cooling unit produces 5 coldness, atmospheric condenser needs 12 coldness  
- Thermal conduit extends range of thermal unit where each conduit makes subsequent machines take more hot/coldness
- Atmospheric conditions allow machines to function, i.e. vhot room counts as 7 hotness
